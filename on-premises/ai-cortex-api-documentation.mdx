## Attack Detection Mechanism

### Strictness Levels

The attack detection system supports varying levels of strictness to control the sensitivity of detection:

- **Strictness Level 1**:
  - Performs initial detection using a primary model.
  - If an attack is detected, it is flagged immediately.
  - Suitable for environments where false positives need to be minimized.

- **Strictness Level 2**:
  - Always performs both initial detection and advanced detection.
  - Ensures thorough analysis by leveraging multiple detection mechanisms.
  - Balances between sensitivity and accuracy.

- **Strictness Level 3**:
  - Performs advanced detection only if the initial detection does not flag an attack.
  - Aims to catch subtle attacks that might bypass the initial detection.
  - Ideal for high-security environments where any potential threat must be identified.

### Caching Strategy

To optimize performance and reduce redundant computations, the system implements caching mechanisms:

- **Prompt Cache**:
  - Stores the results of prompt analyses keyed by a hash of the prompt and strictness level.
  - Cached results are retrieved for subsequent identical prompts, reducing processing time.
  - Cache entries have an expiration time (e.g., 24 hours) after which they are refreshed.

- **Attack Result Cache**:
  - Stores detailed analysis results associated with an `analysis_id`.
  - Enables quick retrieval of analysis outcomes, especially useful in zero latency mode.

### Zero Latency Mode

Zero latency mode allows for immediate responses to the user without waiting for the analysis to complete:

- **When Enabled**:
  - The system returns a pending status with an `analysis_id`.
  - Analysis is performed asynchronously in the background.
  - The client can retrieve the result later using the `get_analysis_result` endpoint.

- **When Disabled**:
  - The system performs analysis synchronously.
  - The response includes the analysis result, and the user waits for the operation to complete.

### Background Processing

For asynchronous operations, background threads or tasks handle the processing:

- **Background Attack Detection**:
  - Handles the detection process when zero latency mode is enabled.
  - Ensures that main thread performance is not hindered.

- **Asynchronous Logging**:
  - Attack logs and safe message records are stored without blocking the main execution flow.
  - Utilizes asynchronous functions to interact with the database and cache.

### Advanced Attack Detection

The system employs advanced detection techniques for enhanced security:

- **Initial Detection**:
  - Uses a primary detection model to analyze prompts.
  - Provides a label (e.g., `SAFE` or `INJECTION`) and a confidence score.

- **Advanced Detection**:
  - Activated based on strictness levels and initial detection results.
  - Deploys additional models or methods to confirm or refute the presence of an attack.
  - Helps in reducing false negatives and improving overall detection accuracy.

---

## Notification System

To alert administrators or stakeholders about detected attacks, the system includes a notification mechanism:

- **Email Notifications**:
  - Sends automated emails to a predefined address when an attack is detected.
  - Includes details such as the chatbot source, attack type, timestamp, and attack ID.
  - Utilizes a templated HTML email for clarity and professionalism.

- **Configuration**:
  - Email recipients and settings can be configured in the environment variables or configuration files.
  - Notifications can be toggled on or off based on the `notifications` flag in the request.

## Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Certain configurations, such as model names and ports, are set using environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Security**: Ensure that the API keys and sensitive information are stored securely and not exposed in client-side code.
- **Error Handling**: The system provides meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes for different failure scenarios.
