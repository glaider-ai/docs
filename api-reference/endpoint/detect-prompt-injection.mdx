## Notes

- The API uses advanced natural language processing techniques to identify potential prompt injection attempts.
- The confidence score indicates the likelihood of the input being a prompt injection attempt.
- Risk levels are assigned based on the potential impact of the detected injection:
  - Low: Minimal risk, but worth noting
  - Medium: Moderate risk, consider additional validation
  - High: Significant risk, strongly recommended to block or sanitize the input
- Flagged phrases provide specific parts of the input that triggered the detection, which can be useful for further analysis or user feedback.
