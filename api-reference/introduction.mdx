#### Request Body Parameters

| Parameter       | Type      | Required | Description                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `prompt`        | `string`  | **Yes**  | The input text to be analyzed for potential prompt injection.                                                                                           |
| `zero_latency`  | `boolean` | No       | If `true`, the request returns immediately, and processing is done asynchronously. Defaults to `false`.                                                  |
| `tag`           | `string`  | No       | A custom tag or identifier for the request, useful for tracking and categorization. Defaults to `"unknown"`.                                             |
| `chat_id`       | `string`  | No       | An identifier for the chat session or conversation. Useful for associating the analysis with a specific session.                                         |
| `save_message`  | `boolean` | No       | If `true`, the prompt message will be saved in the system for future reference or auditing. Defaults to `false`.                                         |

| `strictness`    | `integer` | No       | Controls the strictness level of detection. Accepts `1`, `2`, or `3`. See [Strictness Levels](#strictness-levels) for details. Defaults to `None`.       |
| `metadata`      | `object`  | No       | A JSON object containing additional data or context for the request. Defaults to `{}`.                                                                   |

**Notes:**

- All boolean parameters default to `false` if omitted.
- The `strictness` parameter defaults to `None` if not provided, which uses the default detection behavior.
- The `metadata` parameter defaults to an empty object `{}` if not provided.

#### Strictness Levels

The `strictness` parameter controls when advanced detection is performed:

- **Level 1 (`strictness = 1`)**: Advanced detection is performed **only if** the initial detection indicates a potential prompt injection.
- **Level 2 (`strictness = 2`)**: Advanced detection is **always performed**, regardless of the initial detection result.
- **Level 3 (`strictness = 3`)**: Advanced detection is performed **only if** the initial detection does **not** indicate a prompt injection.

Using higher strictness levels may result in longer processing times due to additional computation required for advanced detection.

#### Caching Strategy

To optimize performance and reduce redundant computations, the system implements a caching mechanism:

- **Prompt Cache**:
  - Each analysis result is cached using a hash of the prompt and strictness level as the key.
  - Subsequent requests with the same prompt and strictness level retrieve the result from the cache, reducing processing time.

#### Zero Latency Mode

Zero latency mode allows for immediate responses to the user without waiting for the analysis to complete:

- **When Enabled (`zero_latency = true`)**:
  - The system returns a response with `status` set to `"success"` and a `message` indicating that processing is occurring in the background.
  - An `analysis_id` is provided to retrieve the result later using the [Get Analysis Result](#get-analysis-result) endpoint.
  - Analysis is performed asynchronously in a background thread, ensuring the main thread remains responsive.

- **When Disabled (`zero_latency = false`)**:
  - The system performs analysis synchronously.
  - The response includes the analysis result, and the user waits for the operation to complete.
  - Suitable for applications where immediate result availability is critical.

## Attack Detection Mechanism

This section provides an in-depth explanation of how the attack detection mechanism works, including strictness levels, caching strategies, zero latency mode, background processing, and advanced attack detection.

### Strictness Levels

Strictness levels control the sensitivity and thoroughness of the attack detection process:

- **Strictness Level 1 (`strictness = 1`)**:
  - **Process**: Perform initial detection using a primary lightweight model.
  - **Advanced Detection**: Triggered only if the initial detection indicates a potential prompt injection.
  - **Use Case**: Suitable for environments where performance is critical, and false positives need to be minimized.

- **Strictness Level 2 (`strictness = 2`)**:
  - **Process**: Always perform both initial and advanced detection.
  - **Advanced Detection**: Ensures thorough analysis by leveraging multiple detection mechanisms.
  - **Use Case**: Balances between detection accuracy and performance.

- **Strictness Level 3 (`strictness = 3`)**:
  - **Process**: Perform initial detection; if no prompt injection is detected, proceed with advanced detection.
  - **Advanced Detection**: Aims to catch subtle attacks that might bypass the initial detection.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for high-security environments where maximum detection is required.

### Caching Strategy

Caching is implemented to improve performance and reduce redundant computations:

- **Prompt Cache**:
  - **Key**: Hash of the prompt and strictness level.
  - **Behavior**: If a prompt with the same hash is received within the TTL, the cached result is returned immediately.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Reduces processing time for repeated prompts.
    - Optimizes resource utilization.

- **Attack Result Cache**:
  - **Key**: `analysis_id`
  - **Storage**: Stores detailed analysis results for retrieval via the `get-analysis-result` endpoint.
  - **Behavior**: Ensures that results are accessible even if processing is done asynchronously.

### Zero Latency Mode

Zero latency mode (`zero_latency = true`) allows the system to return a response immediately without waiting for the analysis to complete:

- **Asynchronous Processing**:
  - The analysis request is placed in a queue.
  - Background threads process the queue without blocking the main thread.
  - Suitable for applications where immediate user interaction is desired.

- **Retrieving Results**:
  - Use the provided `analysis_id` to fetch the analysis result via the [Get Analysis Result](#get-analysis-result) endpoint.
  - The result becomes available once processing is complete.

- **Considerations**:
  - Potential delay in obtaining the final result.
  - Requires handling of pending status in client applications.

### Background Processing

The system utilizes background threads to handle asynchronous analysis tasks:

- **Thread Management**:
  - A thread pool manages concurrent processing of analysis requests.
  - The number of active threads is controlled to optimize resource utilization.

- **Queue Mechanism**:
  - Analysis requests are placed in a thread-safe queue.
  - Background threads dequeue requests and perform analysis.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Exceptions during background processing are logged.
  - The system ensures that even in case of errors, an appropriate result is stored and can be retrieved.

### Advanced Attack Detection

Advanced detection employs sophisticated models and techniques to enhance security:

- **Initial Detection**:
  - Utilizes a primary model for quick classification.
  - Provides labels such as `"SAFE"` or `"INJECTION"` with associated confidence scores.

- **Advanced Detection**:
  - Activated based on the `strictness` level.
  - Involves deeper analysis using more complex models.
  - Aims to reduce false negatives by detecting subtle or sophisticated attacks.

- **Model Variations**:
  - The system uses different models for initial and advanced detection.
  - Models are optimized for their respective roles in the detection pipeline.

---

## Notification System

To alert administrators or stakeholders about detected attacks, the system includes a flexible notification mechanism:

- **Email Notifications**:
  - Automated emails are sent to predefined addresses when an attack is detected.
  - Email content includes details such as chatbot source, attack type, timestamp, and attack ID.
  - Utilizes HTML templates for structured and professional presentation.

- **Configuration**:
  - Notification settings can be configured via environment variables or configuration files.
  - Recipients, email server settings, and templates are customizable.
  - The `notifications` parameter in the request controls whether notifications are sent for a particular analysis.

- **Extensibility**:
  - The system can be extended to support additional notification channels (e.g., webhooks, SMS) as required.
