<Note>
  All requests to the Glaider API must be authenticated using an API key.
  You can request it by contacting the support.

## Using Your API Key

Once you have your API key, you need to include it in the header of all API requests.

### API Key Header

Add the following header to your HTTP requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Glaider API key.
