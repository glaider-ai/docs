Secrets Sniper is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers identify and manage sensitive data in their code. It automatically detects potential security risks such as API keys, passwords, and other confidential information, allowing you to quickly move them to a secure .env file or ignore false positives.
It interacts with the Glaider Dashboard to provide a seamless experience for managing sensitive data.
